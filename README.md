- 👋 Hi, I’m Habeeb Rasheed
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in digital marketing mostly around social and environmental justice issues.
I have training and years of experience with consultative sales. I am looking for ways to leverage my experience with sales, and interest in marketing and social justice, into clever money-making marketing opportunities. 
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, jQuery, and applying this to UX/UI.   Of course this is not all I am learning now, but the most relevant to GIT, another thing I am learning.   

- 💞️ My first priority is to collaborate for faster learning, and applying lessons to projects around environmental and social justice issues. I was once called a lone wolf; I did not like it, I would rather be part of a team.   Having years of experience in consultative sales, and growing hands-on experience with digital marketing, I hope to leverage my skill set and interest for life-changing collaborative opportunities.
